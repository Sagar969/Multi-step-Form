## My Process

I chose the process of making it in Mobile view first and then make it responsive for Desktop view. First, I wrote HTML part of a step and style properly then after writing every steps and their styles, I added functionality to it with JavaScript. It was a fun and learning process.

### Built with

- JavaScript
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

In this project, I learned some new concepts and made a strong grip in some others. In the process of code, I :

- Learned the Regular Expressions and used them to validate input values.
- Heavily used flexbox and got a strong grip on flexbox concepts.
- Manipulated DOM content dynamically in almost every part of code.
- Got to learn more about the flow of execution.
